    \section{Abstract}
        In week 3, \texttt{yterm} will be further optimized to handle the input stream more efficiently. My goal for that is to display the rick roll video correctly without too much loss of ``frame rate''. This would likely involve a complete overhaul of the current parser, I might need to implement a custom lexer to replace the current one. Furthermore, to enhance user experience, I'm going to support more functionality in the CanvasRenderer, including copy/paste and text selection.
