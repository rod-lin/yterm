    \section{Abstract}
        In week 1, \texttt{yterm} is going to have basic rendering functionality and will support correct interaction and display of most basic command line programs.
    
    \section{Rubrics}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Correct display of the terminal screen with configurable size (columns and rows).
            \item Correct display of the (blinking) cursor.
            \item Correct parsing of ANSI escape sequences (ignoring color/graphics related sequences now) and separate printable text with control sequences.
            \item Support for basic cursor moving sequences (up/down/right/left/carriage return/backspace).
            \item Support for character inserting/deleting.
            \item Support for scrolling.
            \item Optimize performance and compatibility with \texttt{bash} and other commonly used utilities (\texttt{ls}, \texttt{python}, etc.)
            \item Basic test infrastructure for ANSI escape sequences and terminal.
        \end{itemize}
